    "You feel very frustrated when you discovered that your data has imbalanced classes and that all of the great results you thought you were getting turn out to be a lie. What is even more frustrating is the good books don't even holistically cover this topic.\n",

    "## What is imbalanced data?\n",
    "Imbalanced data typically refers to classification tasks where the classes are not represented equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you may have a binary classification problem with `100` instances out of which `80` instances are labeled with `Class-1`, and the remaining `20` instances are marked with `Class-2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essentially an example of an imbalanced dataset, and the ratio of `Class-1` to `Class-2` instances is `4:1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be it a Kaggle competition or real test dataset, the class imbalance problem is one of the most common ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the real-world classification problems display some level of class imbalance, which happens when there are not sufficient instances of the data that correspond to either of the class labels. Therefore, it is imperative to choose the evaluation metric of your model correctly. If it is not done, then you might end up adjusting/optimizing a useless parameter. In a real business-first scenario, this may lead to a complete waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are problems where a class imbalance is not just common; it is bound to happen. For example, the datasets that deal with fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, it is very likely that the number of fraudulent transactions as compares to the number of non-fraudulent transactions will be very much less. And this is where the problem arises. You will study why."

    "## Why are imbalanced datasets a serious problem to tackle?\n",
    "Although all many machine learning algorithms (both deep and statistical) have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data is still yet to be state-of-the-art. And often, this learning from imbalanced data is referred to as **Imbalanced learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the significant problems of imbalanced learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the dataset has underrepresented data, the class distribution starts skew.\n",
    "- Due to the inherent complex characteristics of the dataset, learning from such data requires new understandings, new approaches, new principles, and new tools to transform data. And moreover, this cannot anyway guarantee an efficient solution to your business problem. In worst cases, it might turn to complete wastes with zero residues to reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point of time one obvious question that must have come to your mind is - why in an age of GPUs, TPUs machine learning algorithms are failing to tackle imbalanced data efficiently? Quite an obvious question and you will find its answer now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation of machine learning algorithms has a lot to do as to the reason why a particular machine learning algorithm does not perform when supplied with imbalanced data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose, you have a dataset (associated with a classification task) with two classes with a distribution ratio of `9:1`. The total number of instances present in the dataset is `1000`, and the class labels are `Class-1` and `Class-2`. Therefore, w.r.t the distribution ratio, the number of instances that correspond to `Class-1` is `900` while `Class-2` instances are `100`. Now, you applied a standard classifier (say `Logistic Regression`) and measured its performance concerning classification accuracy which gives the number of instances correctly classified by the classifier. Now, take a closer look and think very deeply.\n",
    "\n",
    "You Logistic Regression model does not have to be very complicated to classify all the 1000 instances as `Class-1`. In that case, you would get a classification accuracy of `90%` which is really not enough to test the actual quality of the classifier. Clearly, you need some other metric to evaluate the performance of the system. You will see that in a minute. The phenomenon you just studied is called **Accuracy Paradox**."

    "## Approaches for handling imbalanced data:\n",
    "You will start this section by studying some metrics other than classification accuracy in order to truly judge a classifier when it is dealing with imbalanced data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define four fundamental terms here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Positive (TP)** – An instance that is positive and is classified correctly as positive\n",
    "- **True Negative (TN)** – An instance that is negative and is classified correctly as negative\n",
    "- **False Positive (FP)** – An instance that is negative but is classified wrongly as positive\n",
    "- **False Negative (FN)** – An instance that is positive but is classified incorrectly as negative\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image will justify the above terms for themselves:\n",
    "<img src = 'http://www.chioka.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Metrics-Table-580x280.png' />\n",
    "[Image Source](http://www.chioka.in/class-imbalance-problem/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assume that you trained another classifier on the toy dataset you just saw and this time you applied a Random Forest. And you got a classification accuracy of `70%`. Now that, you know about True Positive and Negative Rates and False Positive and Negative Rates, you will investigate the performance of the earlier `Logistic Regression` and `Random Forest` in a bit more detailed manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you got the following True Positive and Negative Rates and False Positive and Negative Rates for the `Logistic Regression` model:\n",
    "<img src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1539113868/Capture1_l9fvnu.png />\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assume that the True Positive and Negative Rates and False Positive and Negative Rates for the `Random Forest` model are following:\n",
    "<img src = 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1539113868/Capture2_ol19nx.png />\n",
    "\n",
    "Just look at the number of **negative classes** correctly predicted (**True Negatives**) by both of the classifiers. As you are dealing with an imbalanced dataset, you need to give this number the most priority (because `Class-1` dominant in the dataset). So, considering that, `Random Forest` trades away `Logistic Regression` easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you are in an excellent place to study the approaches for combating imbalanced dataset problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Remember, the above representation is popularly known as the **Confusion Matrix**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are the two terms that are derived from the confusion matrix and very much used when you are evaluating a classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision**: Precision is the number of **True Positives** divided by the number of True Positives and False Positives. Put another way; it is the number of positive predictions divided by the total number of positive class values predicted. It is also called the Positive Predictive Value (PPV).\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision can be thought of as a measure of a classifier's *exactness*. A low precision can also indicate **a large number of False Positives**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall**: Recall is the number of True Positives divided by the number of True Positives and the number of False Negatives. Put another way it is the number of positive predictions divided by the number of positive class values in the test data. It is also called Sensitivity or the True Positive Rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall can be thought of as a measure of a classifier's *completeness*. A low recall indicates many **False Negatives**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other metrics that can be useful in this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [AUC](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc)\n",
    "- [ROC Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)\n",
    "- [f1-Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score)\n",
    "- [Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin studying the approaches to tackle class-imbalance problem let's take a very real-world example where just choosing classification accuracy as the evaluation metric can produce disastrous results. (You are doing this to ensure you do not only consider classification accuracy when you train your next classifier.)"

But in this case, taking any help from the majority class, you increase the instances corresponding to the minority class by replicating them up to a constant degree. In this case, you do not decrease the number of instances assigned to the majority class. Say, you have a dataset with `1000` instances where `980` instances correspond to the majority class, and the reaming `20` instances correspond to the minority class. Now you over-sample the dataset by replicating the `20` instances up to `20` times. As a result, after performing over-sampling the total number of instances in the minority class will be `400`.\n",

It was proposed in 2002, and you can take a look at the [original SMOTE paper](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/%22http://www.jair.org/papers/paper953.html%22).

The minority class is **over-sampled** by taking each minority class sample and introducing synthetic examples along the line segments joining any/all of the k minority class nearest neighbors. Depending upon the amount of over-sampling required, neighbors from the k nearest neighbors are randomly chosen.\n",

    "**NOTE**: In other words, instead of **copying** instances in the minority class, new instances **similar to** the original instances are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of SMOTE is the construction of the minority classes. The intuition behind the construction algorithm is simple. You have already studied that oversampling causes overfitting, and because of repeated instances, the decision boundary gets tightened. What if you could generate similar samples instead of repeating them? In the original SMOTE paper (linked above) it has been shown that to a machine learning algorithm, these newly constructed instances are not exact copies, and thus it softens the decision boundary and thereby helping the algorithm to approximate the hypothesis more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some advantages and disadvantages of SMOTE -\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages -\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alleviates overfitting caused by random oversampling as synthetic examples are generated rather than replication of instances.\n",
    "- No loss of information.\n",
    "- It's simple to implement and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages -\n",
    "\n",
    "- While generating synthetic examples, SMOTE does not take into consideration neighboring examples can be from other classes. This can increase the overlapping of classes and can introduce additional noise.\n",
    "- SMOTE is not very practical for high dimensional data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some variants of SMOTE such as safe-level SMOTE, border-line SMOTE, OSSLDDD-SMOTE, etc. If you want to use SMOTE and its other variants you can check the scikit-learn-contrib module as mentioned before.
