    "# Fundamental Stats Required for Data Science and Machine Learning in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "f you have little experience in applying machine learning algorithm, you would have discovered that it does not require any knowledge of Statistics as a prerequisite.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, knowing some statistics can be beneficial to understand machine learning technically as well intuitively. Knowing some statistics will eventually be required when you want to start validating your results and interpreting them. After all, when there is data, there are statistics. Like Mathematics is the language of Science. Statistics is one of a kind language for Data Science and Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is a field of mathematics with lots of theories and findings. However, there are various concepts, tools, techniques, and notations are taken from this field to make machine learning what it is today. You can use descriptive statistical methods to help transform observations into useful information that you will be able to understand and share with others. You can use inferential statistical techniques to reason from small samples of data to whole domains. Later in this post, you will study descriptive and inferential statistics. So, don't worry.\n",

    "- Problem Framing: Requires the use of exploratory data analysis and data mining.\n",
    "- Data Understanding: Requires the use of summary statistics and data visualization.\n",
    "- Data Cleaning: Requires the use of outlier detection, imputation and more.\n",
    "- Data Selection: Requires the use of data sampling and feature selection methods.\n",
    "- Data Preparation: Requires the use of data transforms, scaling, encoding and much more.\n",
    "- Model Evaluation: Requires experimental design and resampling methods.\n",
    "- Model Configuration: Requires the use of statistical hypothesis tests and estimation statistics.\n",
    "- Model Selection: Requires the use of statistical hypothesis tests and estimation statistics.\n",
    "- Model Presentation: Requires the use of estimation statistics such as confidence intervals.\n",

    "## Introduction to Statistics and its types:\n",
    "Let's briefly study how to define statistics in simple terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is considered a subfield of mathematics. It refers to a multitude of methods for working with data and using that data to answer many types of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to the statistical tools that are used in practice, it can be helpful to divide the field of statistics into two broad groups of methods: descriptive statistics for summarizing data, and inferential statistics for concluding samples of data ([Statistics for Machine Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistics_for_machine_learning/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics are used to describe the essential features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Together with simple graphics analysis, they form the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis of data. The below infographic provides a good summary of descriptive statistics:\n",

    "_Source: IntellSpot_\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Statistics for data preparation:\n",
    "Statistical methods are required in the development of train and test data for your machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes techniques for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outlier detection\n",
    "- Missing value imputation\n",
    "- Data sampling\n",
    "- Data scaling\n",
    "- Variable encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic understanding of data distributions, descriptive statistics, and data visualization is required to help you identify the methods to choose when performing these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze each of the above points briefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outlier detection:\n",
    "Let's first see what an outlier is.\n",
    "\n",
    "An outlier is considered an observation that appears to deviate from other observations in the sample. The following figure makes the definition more prominent.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/submissions/34795/versions/7/screenshot.png' />\n",
    "_Source: MathWorks_\n",
    "\n",
    "You can spot the outliers (in __RED__) in the data as given the above figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the range and distribution of attribute values in the input data. Outliers in input data can **skew** and **mislead** the training process of machine learning algorithms resulting in longer training times, less accurate models and ultimately more mediocre results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identification of potential outliers is vital for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An outlier could indicate the data is bad. In example, the data maybe coded incorrectly, or the experiment did not run correctly. If it can be determined that an outlying point is, in fact, erroneous, then the value that is outlying should be removed from the analysis. If it is possible to correct that is another option.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a few cases, it may not be possible to determine whether an outlying point is a bad data point. Outliers could be due to random variation or could possibly indicate something scientifically interesting. In any event, you typically do not want to just delete the outlying observation. However, if the data contains significant outliers, you may need to consider the use of robust statistical techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, outliers are often not good for your predictive models (Although, sometimes, these outliers can be used as an advantage. But that is out of the scope of this post). You need the statistical know-how to handle outliers efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing value imputation:\n",
    "Well, most of the datasets now suffer from the problem of missing values. Your machine learning model may not get trained effectively if the data that you are feeding to the model contains missing values. Statistical tools and techniques come here for the rescue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people tend to discard the data instances which contain a missing value. But that is __NOT__ a good practice because during that course you may lose essential features/representations of the data. Although there are advanced methods for dealing with missing value problems, these are the quick techniques that one would go for: **Mean Imputation** and **Median Imputation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is imperative that you understand what mean and median are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say, you have a feature X1 which has these values - `13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13`\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the usual average, so I'll add and then divide:\n",
    "\n",
    "`(13 + 18 + 13 + 14 + 13 + 16 + 14 + 21 + 13) / 9 = 15`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the mean, in this case, isn't a value from the original list. This is a common result. You should not assume that your mean will be one of your original numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle value, so first, you will have to rewrite the list in numerical order:\n",
    "\n",
    "`13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 16, 18, 21`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are nine numbers in the list, so the middle one will be the `(9 + 1) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5th` number:\n",
    "\n",
    "`13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 16, 18, 21`\n",
    "\n",
    "So the median is `14`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sampling:\n",
    "Data is considered the currency of applied machine learning. Therefore, its collection and usage both are equally significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sampling refers to statistical methods for selecting observations from the domain with the objective of estimating a population parameter. In other words, sampling is an active process of gathering observations with the intent of estimating a population variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of a dataset represents an observation that is indicative of a particular population. When working with data, you often do not have access to all possible observations. This could be for many reasons, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It may be difficult or expensive to make more observations.\n",
    "- It may be challenging to gather all the observations together.\n",
    "- More observations are expected to be made in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: in data science/machine learning, we sample/split data since we need to validate model accuracy/efficiency - this is a __MUST-HAVE__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, you will not have the right proportion of the data samples. So, you will have to *under-sample* or *over-sample* based on the type of problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "You perform under-sampling when the data samples for a particular category are very high compared to other meaning you discard some of the data samples from the category where they are higher. You perform over-sampling when the data samples for a particular type are decidedly lower compared to the other. In this case, you generate data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This applies to multi-class scenarios as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical sampling is a large field of study, but in applied machine learning, there may be three types of sampling that you are likely to use: simple random sampling, systematic sampling, and stratified sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple Random Sampling: Samples are drawn with a uniform probability from the domain.\n",
    "- Systematic Sampling: Samples are drawn using a pre-specified pattern, such as at intervals.\n",
    "- Stratified Sampling: Samples are drawn within pre-specified categories (i.e., strata).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these are the more common types of sampling that you may encounter, there are other techniques ([A Gentle Introduction to Statistical Sampling and Resampling](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-sampling-and-resampling/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Scaling:\n",
    "Often, the features of your dataset may widely vary in ranges. Some features may have a scale of `0` to `100` while the other may have ranges of `0.01 - 0.001`, `10000- 20000`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very problematic for efficient modeling. Because a small change in the feature which has a lower value range than the other feature may not have a significant impact on those other features. It affects the process of good learning. Dealing with this problem is known as **data scaling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE__: you do __NOT__ want your features (continuous ones) at difference scales since the difference scales may affect your model differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different data scaling techniques such as `Min-Max scaling`, `Absolute scaling`, `Standard scaling`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, your datasets contain a mixture of both numeric and non-numeric data. Many machine learning frameworks like `scikit-learn` expect all the data to be present in all numeric format. This is also helpful to speed up the computation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, statistics come for saving you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Techniques like `Label encoding, One-Hot encoding`, etc. are used to convert non-numeric data to numeric."

    "Let's proceed with `Z-Score` now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"*The Z-score is the signed number of standard deviations by which the value of an observation or data point is above the mean value of what is being observed or measured.*\" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Z-score&redirect=no)\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind `Z-score` is to describe any data point regarding their relationship with the Standard Deviation and Mean for the group of data points. Z-score is about finding the distribution of data where the mean is `0`, and the standard deviation is `1`, i.e., __normal distribution__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait! How on earth does this help in identifying the outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, while calculating the Z-score you re-scale and center the data (mean of `0` and standard deviation of `1`) and look for the instances which are too far from zero. These data points that are way too far from zero are treated as the outliers. In most common cases the threshold of `3` or `-3` is used. In example, say the Z-score value is greater than or less than `3` or `-3` respectively. This data point will then be identified as an outlier.\n",
